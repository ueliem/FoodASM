====================

Our submission for the Disrupt NYC Hackathon.

This is a Meal planner and shopping list on the go. Log in through evernote, pick an ingredient, choose a dish, and then export your shopping list to Evernote.

We used the Pearson Kitchen Manager API for its recipe database, and Evernote for its account integration and easy exporting of the shopping lists.

We are a father-son team and this is our first hackathon.
